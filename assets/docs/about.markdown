The Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository is a place to upload documents relevant to local governance.

You can use this site to share PDFs, Excel files, PowerPoint documents, raw data, and other files produced by local governmental bodies, including the City, County, and School District. Uploaded documents are given a clean URL that -- among many uses -- can be shared via email, posted in online forums, and contributed to local newspapers.

This site is free to use. There is no registration process, but you must provide a valid email address. Your email will not be published. 

We reserve the right to moderate submissions. 

### Large documents & collections

If you have large files (more than 50MB per file) or large collections of files (more than 10), the default upload form may not work for you. Please contact us directly at [info@arborwiki.org][4], and we will work with you to coordinate a batch upload.
